We consider the problem of verifying safety properties of heap-manipulating programs.
A central challenge in such verification is to infer auxiliary
invariants on the heap that enable one to prove the desired goal property.
Inferring such invariants is tricky for current software verifiers
due to the limitations of deductive proof engines for existing heap logics
to automatically extract them during proof search.
In this thesis, we propose an alternative oracle-guided approach for
heap invariant synthesis. Our approach reduces the verification problem to
one of inductive synthesis, where the safety verification problem is
reduced to one of synthesizing a heap separator pattern from positive
and negative examples of heaps.
This reduction makes our approach modular by offloading the invariant
synthesis step to an external oracle. This oracle can be implemented in
various ways, with varying degrees of expressiveness and automation. We demonstrate one practical implementation of the oracle-guided approach, showing that it is effective in practice via an evaluation on benchmarks from recent software verification competitions, where we can outperform the state of the art verifiers.

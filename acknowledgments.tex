\begin{abstract}
  There are several people I'd like to thank for making this thesis possible. First
  and foremost, my advisor Prof. Sanjit Seshia, who not only encouraged me to pursue
  my own research ideas, but
  also constantly supported me and was patient with the many setbacks in my eventually
  doomed graduate career. I'd also like to thank Prof. Bill Harris, Prof. Somesh Jha, and
  Drew Davidson, who have had a major role to play in defining and concretizing the
  ideas presented in this thesis. It is only due to our sustained collaboration that this
  work managed to get into the present state. I would also like to thank Prof. Bj{\"o}rn Hartmann, whose valuable comments made this thesis much more robust and well-rounded.
  I'd also like to thank him for being considerate about the difficult circumstances
  surrounding the conclusion of this work.

  Before I thank other people, it would be unfair if I didn't briefly describe how working
  on this thesis (and graduate school) affected me personally. I will forever remember
  this time as one of the darkest periods of my life. It was partly due to severe
  personal difficulties that led to chronic depression, that frequently was seriously
  self-destructive for me. At other times, it was milder, but always a constant
  hindrance towards my ability to make progress with research. It made a severe dent
  in relationships with friends and family, but I'd like to thank those who stood by
  me. First of all, I thank my parents, who have always supported me in everything I chose
  to do, including my successes and failures, and positively encouraged me to
  never underestimate my abilities. I'd also like to thank my girlfriend Vasuki, who
  has possibly had to bear the most immediate impact of this period. Despite her own
  issues, she was often the only who truly listened to me, and helped me in real ways.
  I msut thank my other friends in Berkeley -- Vaishnavi, Debanjan, Sharanya,
  and Vikram who provided me with the

  While finishing this thesis represents an extremely positive development in my life,
  and I would like to move on from it, I want to add a note on how the system failed
  me in several ways.

  There are several people I'd like to thank for making this thesis possible. First
  and foremost, my advisor Prof. Sanjit Seshia, who not only encouraged me to pursue
  my own research ideas, but
  also constantly supported me and was patient with the many setbacks in my eventually
  doomed graduate career. I'd also like to thank Prof. Bill Harris, Prof. Somesh Jha, and
  Drew Davidson, who have had a major role to play in defining and concretizing the
  ideas presented in this thesis. It is only due to our sustained collaboration that this
  work managed to see the light of day. I would also like to
  thank Prof. Bj{\"o}rn Hartmann, whose valuable comments made this
  thesis much more robust and well-rounded. I'd also like to thank him for being
  considerate about the difficult circumstances surrounding the conclusion of this work.

  Before I thank other people, it would be unfair if I didn't briefly describe how working
  on this thesis (and graduate school) affected me personally. I will forever remember
  this time as one of the darkest periods of my life. It was partly due to severe
  personal difficulties that led to chronic depression and a seriously
  self-destructive for me. At other times, it was milder, but always a constant
  hindrance towards my ability to make progress with research. It made a severe dent
  in relationships with friends and family, but I'd like to thank those who stood by
  me. First of all, I'd like to thank my girlfriend Vasuki, who
  has had to bear the most immediate impact of this dark period. Despite her own
  issues, she was often the only who truly listened to me, and made a conscious
  effort to understand my problems and help me in concrete ways. A lot of the
  motivation to finish this work and move on in life wouldn't have been possible
  without her. I'd also like to thank my parents, who have
  always supported me in everything I chose
  to do, including my successes and failures, and positively encouraged me to
  never underestimate my abilities.
  I must thank my other friends in Berkeley -- Avinash, Vaishnavi, Debanjan, Sharanya,
  and Vikram who provided me with the sense of community that invariably played
  a large role in surviving this painful phase. Avinash in particular
  was a constantly calming
  presence particularly in the crunch period of when I missed the final
  submission deadline and was facing dire consequences. I'd also like to thank
  a few of my other friends -- Anasuya, Abhay, Pradeep, Pramod, Vishal, Namit, and
  Ravi, who despite being physically further away understood the pain and
  frustration I faced for months. My conversations with Anasuya in the worst of times
  have been an invaluable source of stability.

  While finishing this thesis represents an extremely positive development in my life,
  and I would like to move on from it, I want to add a note on how the system failed
  me in several ways.

\label{ch:conclusion}

In this chapter, we briefly describe existing verification approaches, how they differ from our Oracle-guided approach, and summarize the contributions in this thesis.
\section{Related Work}
\paragraph{Counterexample Guided Abstraction Refinement}
% CEGAR:
A broad class of verifiers of programs and transition systems have
been proposed that implement \emph{counterexample-example guided
  abstraction refinement (CEGAR)}~\cite{clarke03}.
%
The common structure of all of these analyses is that they maintain an
approximate model of the possible runs of a system, and refine the
model until it represents a proof of correctness by iteratively (1)
choosing a path of execution $p$ allowed by the model that, if
feasible, constitutes a property violation, (2) refuting the
feasibility of $p$, and (3) using the refutation to refine the paths
of execution allowed by the model.
% Relative Completeness of Abstraction Refinement for Software Model
% Checking: Oracle is really angelic non-determinism.
The CEGAR-based analysis that is most closely related to the
one proposed in this work is actually a \emph{theoretical} analysis
that chooses program facts from which to construct a refutation by
querying a \emph{widening Oracle}~\cite{ball02}.
%
The key property of the counterexample-guided analysis is that if there is
sequence of widenings that the Oracle can possible choose to cause the
analysis to verify a program, then the analysis will eventually verify
the program successfully.
%
Because the Oracle does not solve a distinct problem, but instead
provides values to the analysis, it can be viewed as an agent of
\emph{angelic non-determinism}~\cite{bodik10}.
% Us:
While \verifier also queries an Oracle, the Oracle solves a problem
distinct from providing values to the analysis, namely an active
learning problem over both positive \emph{and negative} example
heap graphs.

\paragraph{Predicate Abstraction}
% Predicate Abstraction:
-predicate abstraction: predicates in logic can't describe shapes
\cite{ball01,henzinger02,henzinger04}
% Us:

\paragraph{Interpolation}
% Interpolation
also builds an unwinding tree of invariants, but still
can't describe
shapes\cite{albarghouthi12,heizmann10,mcmillan06,rummer13}
% Us

\paragraph{Active Learning}
% Active learning
Mahdu's paper: only works on bounded tuples of
lists~\cite{garg13}
% Us

\paragraph{Shape Analysis}

-memory graphs: TVLA~\cite{sagiv02}, SMG's\cite{dudka13}

-separation logic~\cite{calcagano11,reynolds02}

A lot of text about verification. Then some about the problem domain that is heap programs and stuff. And finally what's existing, what's we doin' yo.

Formal methods encompass a wide variety of techniques used to formally model, verify, and prove properties for several different kinds of systems. Many of these techniques are computationally expensive or undecidable. In the case of software, traditional formal methods do not scale to the size of software found in modern computer systems. Formal verification also currently requires highly specialized engineers with deep knowledge of software technology and mathematical theorem-proving techniques. These constraints make current formal verification techniques expensive and time-consuming.

\begin{abstract}
  Chronic depression hindered my ability to make progress with research,
  and the completion of this thesis. For several months,
  I suffered without respite. I also missed several
  deadlines to submit this thesis. At the end, while the department refused
  to make an exception to help me, it was the Disabled Students Program (DSP)
  and some people connected with it who truly understood what I was facing,
  and readily helped me. On the other hand, several conversations I had with people
  in the EECS department (none of whom I wish to name) were not only unhelpful,
  but some were also inconsiderate.
  I do not wish to blame individuals, but it was very clear how poorly equipped
  academic departments can be, when it comes to systematically helping
  students suffering from mental health issues.

  If you're a graduate student who has been
  suffering from mental health issues, remember that help is available, but
  unfortunately you might have to reach out yourself.
  Systems are meant to assist people, but they
  aren't perfect and often fail. I hope that briefly addressing this issue here will
  serve as encouragement to someone, and help shine some light on the issue of
  mental health in academia.

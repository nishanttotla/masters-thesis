\begin{abstract}
  Finally, I'd like to thank the extremely helpful people at the Disabled Students Program
  (DSP) in Berkeley and my therapist, without whose help I'd have
  had to pay thousands of dollars to submit the thesis. The system at the EECS
  department had completely failed me initially. If you're a graduate student
  suffering from mental health issues, remember that help is available. Your research
  does not matter as much as your health. Systems are meant to help people, but they
  aren't perfect and often fail. I hope that briefly addressing this issue here will
  serve as encouragement to someone, and help shine some light on the issue of
  mental health in academia.

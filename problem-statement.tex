\subsection{Problem Definition}
\label{sec:problem-defn}
%
The verification problem that we consider is to determine if any run
of a program reaches a given control location.
% Define the problem formally:
\begin{defn}
  \label{defn:problem-defn}
  % Define analysis problem.
  For each \lang program $\prognm \in \lang$ and control location
  $\locnm \in \locs$, a solution to $\reachprob(\prognm, \locnm)$ is a
  decision as to whether any run of $\prognm$ contains a state whose
  control location is $\locnm$.
\end{defn}
